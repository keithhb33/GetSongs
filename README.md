## Features

1. **Download Videos** as MP4 in the highest available resolution.  
2. **Extract Audio** as MP3 by simply renaming the audio-only file (no ffmpeg needed).  
3. **Remembers Download Folder** across sessions (stores `settings.json` next to the `.exe` or in the script directory).  
4. **Simple GUI** with no console window.  
5. **Packaged as a Single Executable** using PyInstaller, so you can run it on most Windows machines without installing Python.

## How It Works

1. **User enters a YouTube URL** and selects a download format (MP4 or MP3).  
2. **App fetches metadata** via [`pytubefix`](#) (a forked or local version of PyTube).  
3. **MP4 Download**: The highest-resolution video+audio stream is saved.  
4. **MP3 Download**: An audio-only stream is downloaded, then the file extension is renamed from `.mp4` (or `.m4a`) to `.mp3`.   
   - *(In most players, this is enough to play the track. If you need a true MP3 container, consider using ffmpeg to convert instead.)*

## Usage

### Running the Source Python Script
